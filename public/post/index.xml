      <description>In the previous post on ‘pulling text data from the internet’, I experimented with pulling out the dream text from a sample of dreams from the website “DreamBank” at: http://www.dreambank.net/random_sample.cgi.
In this follow-up post, I will demonstrate some of the methods presented in Julia Silge and David Robinson’s book ‘Text Mining with R’ for processing text data, as applied to 400 dreams sampled from 4 collections in the dreambank. I used the methods described in the last post to pull out a random sample of 100 dreams from each of the following 4 groups:</description>

      <description>I have been working on the area of alexithymia for the last couple of years, a sub-clinical condition in which people find it difficult to identify and describe their emotions. I am currently analysing a dataset containing transcripts of interviews with people with and without alexithymia and I wanted to try out some R tools for text analysis. However, to do a blog post I needed some public data, and while mulling over what data I might use, I stumbled upon a line in “You are a thing and I love you” - the wonderful new book on AI by Janelle Shane.</description>

      <description>Recently, while trying to compare the distribution of two samples, I discovered that you can plot both on the same graph in base R, which is a nice feature if you just want to examine the data quickly. We can explore this with a psychological dataset from the Open Psychometrics site. This hosts a range of open psychometric tests and stores the data in an accessible form. Let’s pull out the data for the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (note that there are two different scoring methods in common use on this scale - on the website they have used a 1 - 4 Likert scale for the data output as a csv, but it is not unusual to see the use of a 0 - 3 scale, (which is the method used to give participants on the website feedback) so we need to be cautious when comparing these total scores with published norms (see https://socy.</description>
